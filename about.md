Hi, I’m a developer based in Quito, Ecuador. I like to work on challenging projects involving cutting-edge technology to create useful products.

I consider myself a student, a learner, an enthusiastic about coding. I spend a great deal of my spare time learning new languages or improving my coding skills. I’m currently focused on Python and PHP, but I also like to work with HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery.

As a developer, I try to think beyond conventional technology and explore new ideas to meet current challenges. I enjoy working across disciplines to challenge the boundaries between technology and humanities. I firmly believe they both elevate each other, and it’s undeniable that understanding different perspectives is important to address common issues.

When I’m not coding, I read.
